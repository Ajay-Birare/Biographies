              William Henry Gates III (born October 28, 1955) is an American
              business magnate, philanthropist and investor. He is a co-founder
              of Microsoft, along with his late childhood friend Paul
              Allen.[2][3] During his career at Microsoft, Gates held the
              positions of chairman, chief executive officer (CEO), president
              and chief software architect, while also being the largest
              individual shareholder until May 2014.[4] He was a major
              entrepreneur of the microcomputer revolution of the 1970s and
              1980s. Gates was born and raised in Seattle. In 1975, he and Allen
              founded Microsoft in Albuquerque, New Mexico. It became the
              world's largest personal computer software company.[5][a] Gates
              led the company as chairman and CEO until stepping down as CEO in
              January 2000, succeeded by Steve Ballmer, but he remained chairman
              of the board of directors and became chief software architect.[8]
              During the late 1990s, he was criticized for his business tactics,
              which have been considered anti-competitive. This opinion has been
              upheld by numerous court rulings.[9] In June 2008, Gates
              transitioned to a part-time role at Microsoft and full-time work
              at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the private charitable
              foundation he and his then-wife Melinda established in 2000.[10]
              He stepped down as chairman of the board of Microsoft in February
              2014 and assumed a new post as technology adviser to support the
              newly appointed CEO Satya Nadella.[11] In March 2020, Gates left
              his board positions at Microsoft and Berkshire Hathaway to focus
              on his philanthropic efforts on climate change, global health and
              development, and education.[12] Since 1987, Gates has been
              included in the Forbes list of the world's wealthiest
              people.[13][14] From 1995 to 2017, he held the Forbes title of the
              richest person in the world every year except from 2010 to
              2013.[15] In October 2017, he was surpassed by Amazon founder and
              CEO Jeff Bezos, who had an estimated net worth of US$90.6 billion
              compared to Gates's net worth of US$89.9 billion at the time.[16]
              As of March 2023, Gates has an estimated net worth of US$116
              billion, making him the fourth-richest person in the world
              according to Bloomberg News.[17]
